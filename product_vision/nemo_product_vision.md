# The Product Vision Board

## Vision
*What is your motivation for creating the product?*  
Tech training model is pretty crap.  
We want to empower people and make being a dev more fun.  

*What positive changes should it bring about?*  
Getting devs to coach more effectively.  
We want to become experts in our field.  
Organisations will fulfil their technical hiring needs - companies will invest in inexperienced hires rather than fight for attention of experienced devs.  
It will narrow the digital skills gap in the UK.  

## Target Group
