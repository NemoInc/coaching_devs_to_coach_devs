## Intro
Hello I'm Kevin, hello I'm Emmett

__Kevin starts__

We're here to talk about how coaching is hard.

We hope this talk is relevant for everyone. We'll be talking specifically about things coaches at codebar can try but to be honest we think you can apply these anytime you try to help anyone learn anything. 

We were realy interested in how we can become better coaches, and have come up with some dos and donts from a range of googling and personal experience. The majority of these come from 3 sources (codebar's coach guidelines, sarah mei's pairing with junior developers and mary-rose cooks blogs Why I coach and What I do when a student asks for help). 

Lets start with some of our donts.

## Part 1 - Don't do this - Emmett

**Don't give direct answers** - We want to help them get every last bit of learning possible from the problem they're solving. If you give a direct answer you're robbing them of an opportunity to learn.

Try to guide them towards finding the answer for themselves.

If you give the answer you'll get the job done much quicker. But you won't be helping someone overcome their next problem when you're not there.

## Part 2 - Don't do this - Kevin

**Don't stop them making mistakes** -  making mistakes is a great way of learning. debugging is a key skill, figuring out why things have not gone as you expected; if they don't make the mistake and debug it themselves they can't get that invaluable experience. it's so vital. even if it's a typo. actually especially if its a typo. you've got to let the typo happen and give them the opportunity to discover it. and develop the skills to discover it again the next time it happens and the next time.

## Part 3 - Please don't do this - Emmett

**Don't steal the keyboard** - it disempowers the learner. Even if you know they need to fix some obscure environmental configuration, and it'll only take you ten seconds, don't touch the keyboard. Sit on your hands if necessary.

## Part 4 - Do this - Kevin

**Support them**

Because it's really tough learning something in public, and failling in front of someone else. We want to make that uncomfrotable situation as tolerable as possible, so that they build the superpowers of perservere and build resilience.

We want to reassure them - it's ok to struggle. Learning to code is really hard. You might need to explain to them why you're not giving direct answers, why you want to help them figure it out for themselves.

## Part 5 - Also do this - Emmett

**Encourage a growth mindset**
Explain what growth mindset is.
People are really mean to themselves - you can try to bring the mindset away from 'someone who can't make the website' and towards 'Someone who didn't make the website this time'.

## Part 6 - Please do this - Kevin

**Be interested**
Ask the learner about themselves,
Find out about them as a person, what do they know lots about,  what can they teach you, ask thoughtful questions! This can help move ye beyond the coach and student roles and you became two people sharing knowledge.

## Outro - Emmett

Call to action: if you're not already adhering to these guidelines, please pick one and try to follow it next time you're coaching.

Philosophical closer:

Codebar has made this fantastic place. You have a phenomenal opportunity to have a pure learning environment. You'll rarely see that at work, as there'll be business pressures and deadlines, and no one seems to appreciate just how hard it is to facilitate learning. So make the most of it. Go and investigate; here are the three resources we've drawn on for this.
