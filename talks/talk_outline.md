## Intro
Hello I'm Kevin, hello I'm Emmett

~~Back when I was a hospital director, I was under huge financial pressure to keep hiring costs down whilst also hiring the best doctors. This all went out the window as soon as I saw a doctor with this symbol [insert teacher symbol]. Because this doctor is able to train other doctors in specialist skills. They can make surgeons. I don't care how much they cost, or how full their green bar is. They're working here. Because they single handedly reduced the hiring pressure for all other doctors.

~~Get this symbol for yourself. You'll be invaluable.

We hope this talk is relevant for everyone. We'll be addressing coaches. Even if you do not currently see yourself as a coach, you can use these behaviours when you do get to help people.

It also helps to think about why coaches might do these things during a session.

These have been gathered from a range of googling and personal experience, but majority is 3 sources (codebar, mary, sarah mei). Interestingly, a lot of what we found is about what 'not to do', as we're doing too much in our attempts to be helpful.

## Part 1 - Don't do this

**Don't give direct answers** - We want to help them get every last bit of learning possible from the problem they're solving. If you give a direct answer you're robbing them of an opportunity to learn.

Try to guide them towards finding the answer for themselves.

If you give the answer you'll get the job done much quicker. But you won't be helping someone overcome their next problem when you're not there.

## Part 2 - Don't do this

**Don't stop them making mistakes** - got to learn. it is a great way of learning. debugging is a key skill; if you don't make a mistake and debug it yourself you can't get experience of debugging. it's so vital. even if it's a typo. let the typo happen and cause problems. it's life as a developer.

## Part 3 - Please don't do this

**Don't steal the keyboard** - it disempowers the learner. Even if you know they need to fix some obscure environmental configuration, and it'll only take you ten seconds, don't touch the keyboard. Sit on your hands if necessary.

## Part 4 - Do this

**Support them**

Because it's really tough learning something in public, and failling in front of someone else. We want to make that uncomfrotable situation as tolerable as possible, so that they perservere and build resilience.

We want to reassure them - it's ok to struggle. Coding is really hard. This kind of problem solving is really hard. You can explain why you're not giving direct answers, or taking the keyboard.

## Part 5 - Also do this

**Encourage a growth mindset**
Explain what growth mindset is.
People are really mean to themselves - you can try to bring the mindset away from 'someone who can't make the website' and towards 'Someone who didn't make the website this time'.

## Part 6 - Please do this

**Be interested**
Ask them about themselves, what can they teach you?
Find out about them as a person, what do they know lots about, be interested! this will lead to you establishing each other as social equals part of a community, and not simply teacher and student.

## Outro

Call to action: if you're not already adhering to these guidelines, please pick one and try to follow it next time you're coaching.

Philosophical closer:

Codebar has made this fantastic place. You have a phenomenal opportunity to have a pure learning environment. You'll rarely see that at work, as there'll be business pressures and deadlines, and no one seems to appreciate just how hard it is to facilitate learning. So make the most of it.




Before Monday prezzie:

Get slides together.
We need to know the running order, and how to split it.
Try out ping pong prezzie vs half then half.
