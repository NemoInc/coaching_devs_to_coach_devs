Intro

This is relevant for everyone. We'll be addressing coaches. Even if you do not currently see yourself as a coach, you can use these principles when you do get to help people, and also we think you should know about  these effective ways of learning.

We've got some stuff here which is all about optimizing learning to be a developer.

Here's our opinion based on our own research and experience that we think will help learners.

its not about the problem
its not about completing

we dont need another owl website

its about the core mindset

its about skills

behaviours block this

youre not there to get

gym metaphor

block skill acquisition
prevents you from seeing the underlying problem the learner has
that skill is not not knowing html syntax

emotinoally support the learning

learning is uncomfortable

Nietzsche was striving to correct the belief that fulfillment must come easily or not at all, a belief ruinous in its effects, for it leads us to withdraw prematurely from challenges that might have been overcome if only we had been prepared for the savagery legitimately demanded by almost everything valuable.
de Botton

make learning is to make it tolerable

to make as hard as it needs to be

have to be a masochist

wringing every possible learning out of the material

optimal way to get skills to be developers



Don't steal the keyboard - it disempowers the learner. There will be tension - the learner will want you to do it, you'll want to do it. Be supportive, explain if need be why you're not going to. but don't do it.

Don't stop them making mistakes - got to learn. it is a great way of learning. debugging is a key skill; if you don't make a mistake and debug it yourself you can't get experience of debugging. it's so vital. even if it's a typo. let the typo happen and cause problems. it's life as a developer.

Don't give direct answers - Socratic questioning. Finding out how to answer your own questions is huge.

These can all come across as mean, or passive aggressive. Perhaps the learner will resent you holding back this knowledge for "no good reason". Give them a good reason.

Mary has this term of being 'held', meaning: [insert definition here]

Help them feel 'held'

Be lovely. Be fascinated by them, their work they're doing, who they are a person. try to find what they can teach you.

Call to action: if you're not already adhering to these three rules, please pick one and try to follow it next time you're coaching.

We would love for you to pick this up for your time at Codebar. Here's another pitch for anyone coaching.

Back when I was a hospital director, I was under huge financial pressure to keep hiring costs down whilst also hiring the best doctors. This all went out the window as soon as I saw a doctor with this symbol [insert teacher symbol]. Because this doctor is able to train other doctors in specialist skills. He can make surgeons. I don't care how much he costs, or how full his green bar is. He's working here. Because he single handedly reduced the hiring pressure for all other doctors.

Get this symbol for yourself. You'll be invaluable.

Philosophical closer:
Be mindful. Have a think about it. Seriously. What is the point of coaching? What do you want to happen? What does the learner want? Why do we do the things we do?

Codebar has made this fantastic place. You have a phenomenal opportunity to have a pure learning environment. You'll rarely see that at work, as there will be business pressures and deadlines, and no one seems to appreciate just how hard it is to facilitate learning. So make the most of it.

This is an area we're really interested in and deliving into, so if you have any opinions on this, know any good resources or know someone who would be good for us to talk to, please talk to us/slack/twitter or whatever.


Before Monday prezzie:

Get slides together.
We need to know the running order, and how to split it.
Try out ping pong prezzie vs half then half.
