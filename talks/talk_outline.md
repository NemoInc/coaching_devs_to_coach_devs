## Intro
Hello I'm Kevin, hello I'm Emmett

Back when I was a hospital director, I was under huge financial pressure to keep hiring costs down whilst also hiring the best doctors. This all went out the window as soon as I saw a doctor with this symbol [insert teacher symbol]. Because this doctor is able to train other doctors in specialist skills. They can make surgeons. I don't care how much they cost, or how full their green bar is. They're working here. Because they single handedly reduced the hiring pressure for all other doctors.

Get this symbol for yourself. You'll be invaluable.

This is relevant for everyone. We'll be addressing coaches. Even if you do not currently see yourself as a coach, you can use these behaviours when you do get to help people.

It also helps to think about why coaches might do these things during a session.

These have been gathered from a range of googling and personal experience, but majority is 3 sources (codebar, mary, sarah mei). Interestingly, a lot of what we found is about what 'not to do', as we're doing too much in our attempts to be helpful.

## Part 1 - Don't do this

**Don't give direct answers** - Socratic questioning. Finding out how to answer your own questions is huge.
its not about the problem
its not about completing
If you give the answer you'll get the job done much quicker. But you won't be helping someone overcome their next problem when you're not there.

## Part 2 - Don't do this

**Don't stop them making mistakes** - got to learn. it is a great way of learning. debugging is a key skill; if you don't make a mistake and debug it yourself you can't get experience of debugging. it's so vital. even if it's a typo. let the typo happen and cause problems. it's life as a developer.

## Part 3 - Please don't do this

**Don't steal the keyboard** - it disempowers the learner. There will be tension - the learner will want you to do it, you'll want to do it. Be supportive, explain if need be why you're not going to. but don't do it.

## Part 4 - Do this

**Support them**
Emotionally support the learning
Manage the tension and pressure of this situation. It's very vulnerable being in the position of a learner like this. Help them want to come back again next week. Every week.

Be there for them. They're in a very vulnearable situatin where they are failing in public for two hours. We are generally not well-practiced experienced ind doing this.

Your job is to make them feel as safe as possible in an uncomfortable situation. This is where they will be able to learn most effectively without fear of being judged. 

Mary has a lovely phrase which is make them feel held.

## Part 5 - Also do this

**Encourage a growth mindset**
People are really mean to themselves - you can try to bring the mindset away from 'someone who can't make the website' and towards 'Someone who didn't make the website this time'.

## Part 6 - Please do this

**Be interested**
Ask them about themselves, what can they teach you?
Find out about them as a person, what do they know lots about, be interested! this will lead to you establishing each other as social equals part of a community, and not simply teacher and student.

## Outro

Call to action: if you're not already adhering to these guidelines, please pick one and try to follow it next time you're coaching.

Philosophical closer:

Codebar has made this fantastic place. You have a phenomenal opportunity to have a pure learning environment. You'll rarely see that at work, as there'll be business pressures and deadlines, and no one seems to appreciate just how hard it is to facilitate learning. So make the most of it.

## Unused notes

Building resiliency. 


The world doesn't need another owl website. We desperately need more people with the skills to build this website.

its about the core mindset

learning is uncomfortable

Nietzsche was striving to correct the belief that fulfillment must come easily or not at all, a belief ruinous in its effects, for it leads us to withdraw prematurely from challenges that might have been overcome if only we had been prepared for the savagery legitimately demanded by almost everything valuable.
de Botton

make learning is to make it tolerable

to make as hard as it needs to be

have to be a masochist

wringing every possible learning out of the material

These can all come across as mean, or passive aggressive. Perhaps the learner will resent you holding back this knowledge for "no good reason". Give them a good reason.

Mary has this term of being 'held', meaning: [insert definition here]

Help them feel 'held'

Be lovely. Be fascinated by them, their work they're doing, who they are a person. try to find what they can teach you.





Before Monday prezzie:

Get slides together.
We need to know the running order, and how to split it.
Try out ping pong prezzie vs half then half.
