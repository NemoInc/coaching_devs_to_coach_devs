## Goals (as best we can remember)
Produce a presentation on coaching
Deliver the presentation at least once
Get feedback on prezzie

## :) Smiley face
Received feedback from strangers
Asked to do the talk again at Codebar
Presenting rapport
Tone was good - not condescending or judgmental
Prep for 1st prezzie was solid

## :| Flat line mouth face
Need to PR ourselves better
Start a conversation with us about coaching - we want people to come talk to us about coaching
Where does the lightning talk fit into our bigger picture of where we're going with Nemo
Need to be ready to jump and capitalize on interest whenever it happens (planning for success)
Managing the energy of the audience
Emmett needs Twitter

## :( Sad face
Delivery/expectations/prep for 2nd talk at Google
Effective working on prezzie prep
So hard to rehearse prezzies and capture the "energy"

## Actions
Emmett get Twitter
Find authorities
Ask them

Look at unconference

## Ordered backlog for next sprint
Find another two venues for the talk - e.g. Open Source Charities.  
Improve prezzie - it's very focused on Codebar. More context needed.  
Plan how to get participation from audience - decide on call-to-action/s and medium for this.  
Go to Xtreme Tuesdays meetup.  
Networking goal for Xtreme: talk to 3 XPers that I don't know about coaching.  
Figure out what to ask the authorites.
